# Convert-the-photos-to-Van-Gogh-painting

"data_pre.py" is for preprocessing training images to make the the specification uniform
"CycleGanTrain.py" is for cycleGAN model
"VGG19_model.py" is for Neural Style Transfer model

In "data", training Van Gogh's works are in "trainA", and training landscape paintings are in "trainB". These pictures are used for training cycleGAN.
Dataset "testA" includes the Van Gogh's paintings used for testing and the results of turning them into landscapes.
Dataset "testB" includes the landscapes and the results of turning them into Van Gogh's style paintings.

"Neural Networks(1)(1).pptx" is the slide for presentation.
